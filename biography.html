            <p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: left;">My name is Ricardo Rodriguez, I am 18 years old, and I am currently studying Computer Engineering Technology at NAIT. I was always involved with technology
                since a very young age and I continue to be curious about how everything works even to this day. I was born in a small twon called Valencia in
                the caribbean country of Venezuela. At 9 years old, due to economic and safety reasons my parents decided to leave the country in search of a better
                future for their kids. Fast forward a couple of years and I am now graduated from High School and currently looking to start my computer engineering
                career. I started to code as soon as the 7th grade and have had the experience to code in Java, Python, C#, and others.
